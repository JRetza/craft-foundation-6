## Craft Foundation 6 Sass/Gulp Starter Kit
#### Configuration starter kit for Sassy  [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/) with [CraftCMS](http://craftcms.com/) 2 OR 3  

With this simple configuration you will be able to
- add the latest greatest Foundation 6 to your Craft site
- save hours of time in front-end development
- get live previews in the browser while developing without ever hitting reload (browser-sync)

You can get Foundation 6 a plethora of ways, we'll use the [foundation-cli](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/installation.html) for this.

You can `$ npm install --global foundation-cli` then `$ foundation new` and use this starter kit in your newly initialized dir

or  

You can grab/setup Foundation 6 one of the many [other ways](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/installation.html#manual-setup) and copy over the `_settings.scss` file into your `/src/` directory yourself.

**Foundation Install Docs**:
